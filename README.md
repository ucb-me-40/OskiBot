# OskiBot

The purpose of this repository is to provide a minimum working example that aids Cal students and instructors in the process of combining **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and **Conversational Fine-Tuning** using a small language model (Phi-3). The resulting model, OskiBot, uses factual data for knowledge and a fine-tuned LoRA adapter for personality and guided tutoring style.

## 1. Setup and Installation üõ†Ô∏è

### Prerequisites

You need a machine with a **GPU** (e.g., NVIDIA) to run the Phi-3 model and the fine-tuning script efficiently.

### Install Libraries

Install all necessary Python libraries in a single step:

```bash
# Core LLM, PEFT, and Fine-Tuning Libraries (requires torch/cuda support)
pip install torch transformers accelerate peft bitsandbytes trl datasets

# RAG and Vector Database Libraries
pip install langchain-community langchain-text-splitters sentence-transformers chromadb
```

## 2. Data Preparation

You must create the `data` directory and the two data files shown below before running the scripts.

`data/rag_corpus.txt`

This is the knowledge base that RAG will use to answer factual questions.

```
**Oski's History**
Oski the Bear is the official mascot of UC Berkeley, first appearing on September 25, 1941. He is named after the "Oski Wow-Wow" yell. Before Oski, Cal used real bear cubs as mascots. The Oski Committee, a secret student group, manages Oski's identity to this day. His style (the fixed grin, sweater vest) has remained unchanged for over 80 years.

**Cal Football Conference**
The California Golden Bears football team recently moved to the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) as of 2024. They previously competed in the Pac-12. Their home stadium is California Memorial Stadium, built in 1923. The team colors are Blue and Gold. The current head coach is Justin Wilcox.

**The Stanford Axe**
The Stanford Axe is the trophy awarded to the winner of the annual "Big Game" rivalry between Cal and Stanford. The rivalry began in 1892. Cal has held the Axe for the last four seasons as of 2025.
```

```
data/fine_tune_conversations.jsonl
```

This trains the model's personality and its ability to scaffold answers across multiple turns using the correct Phi-3 chat template. Note: Each entry contains the full conversation history up to that point.

A pure victory!\n<|end|>\n"}
