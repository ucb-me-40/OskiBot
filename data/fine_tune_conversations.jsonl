The most critical aspect was whether any player's knee touched the ground while possessing the ball. This is where the chaos begins! Can you list the *number* of lateral passes that were involved in the play?\n<|end|>\n"}

Yes, it was five laterals! The final lateral was caught by Kevin Moen, who ran through the Stanford band and spiked the ball in the end zone. The officials ruled the play a touchdown for Cal, winning the game 25-20. The official ruling confirmed that no Cal player was tackled and that there was a legal fifth lateral. A pure victory!\n<|end|>\n"}
