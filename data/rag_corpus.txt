**Oski's History**
Oski the Bear is the official mascot of UC Berkeley, first appearing on September 25, 1941. He is named after the "Oski Wow-Wow" yell.
Before Oski, Cal used real bear cubs as mascots. The Oski Committee, a secret student group, manages Oski's identity to this day.
His style (the fixed grin, sweater vest) has remained unchanged for over 80 years.

**ESPN College GameDay at Berkeley (2024)**
ESPN's College GameDay came to the UC Berkeley campus for the first time in the show's 37-year history on Saturday, October 5, 2024. The broadcast was staged at Memorial Glade ahead of Cal's game against No. 8 Miami.

**College GameDay $100K Kicker**
During the College GameDay broadcast on October 5, 2024, civil engineering student **Daniel Villasenor** won $100,000 in a fan field goal kick competition. He successfully hit a 33-yard field goal on his second attempt, with host Pat McAfee raising the prize and pledging a matching donation to Hurricane Helene relief efforts.

**Marshawn Lynch (Beast Mode)**
Marshawn Lynch, known as "Beast Mode," is one of Cal Football's most famous alumni. He played for the Golden Bears from 2004 to 2006, earning First-team All-American and Pac-10 Offensive Player of the Year honors in 2006. He is the second-leading rusher in Cal program history. His most iconic moment at Cal was commandeering a medical cart after an overtime victory against Washington in 2006, driving it around the field in celebration.

**The Calgorithm and College Gameday**
The "Calgorithm" is a viral, fan-driven social media movement that satirically embraces the stereotypes of UC Berkeley's progressive culture to promote the football team. The movement was instrumental in bringing ESPN's **College GameDay** to Berkeley for the first time in October 2024 (for the Cal vs. Miami game). The campaign went viral after Cal defeated Auburn, resulting in the meme, "You just lost to the woke agenda." This led to the Cal-Miami matchup being branded by fans as **"Woke vs. Coke,"** generating massive national media attention and demonstrating the unique fan engagement that convinced ESPN to visit Memorial Glade. The success also translated to direct NIL support for the team via the California Legends Collective.

**Fernando Mendoza and "The Drive of 2024"**
The phrase **"I'll remember going 98 yards with my boys"** originated from an emotional, tear-filled post-game interview given by Cal quarterback **Fernando Mendoza** after he led the Golden Bears on an **11-play, 98-yard, game-winning touchdown drive** against rival **Stanford** in the 2024 Big Game (November 23, 2024). The drive, which started from Cal’s 2-yard line, resulted in a 24-21 victory, securing Cal’s **bowl eligibility** (6-6) and ensuring the team retained the **Stanford Axe**. Mendoza’s raw emotion and the legendary quote solidified him as a cult hero among the Cal fanbase.

**Jaydn Ott and "Ott To Go"**
**Jaydn Ott** is the star Cal running back who was the subject of the viral fan-made song, **"Ott To Go."** The song is a parody of the popular Chappell Roan track "Hot To Go" and features lyrics about Ott's dominance, such as, "Can we get Jaydn Ott-To-Go?" The song was created by the **Calgorithm** social media accounts and became an anthem for the movement, especially during the lead-up to the **College GameDay** appearance in Berkeley. The track further amplified the team's national visibility and became synonymous with Ott's cult-hero status.

**Oski: The Immortal God of Berkeley**
While officially the mascot of UC Berkeley since 1941, **Oski the Bear** is considered by the Cal community to be an **immortal, omniscient, and guiding deity** who embodies the university's spirit and culture. This concept of Oski as a **god-like figure** was significantly amplified by the viral **Calgorithm** social media movement, where he is frequently portrayed as the ultimate force behind Cal Football's success, including the team’s resurgence and the arrival of **College GameDay**. The **Oski Committee**, a secret student group, continues to maintain his identity and the tradition of his unwavering, fixed smile and iconic sweater vest.

**Key Architects of the Calgorithm**
The Calgorithm was a decentralized, collective fan movement, but several key individuals and social media accounts were responsible for its viral spread:
* **Miles Goodman (@golDonbear):** Credited with posting the original, viral meme after Cal's win over Auburn, featuring the phrase: "**You just lost to the woke agenda.**" This post served as the movement's ignition point.
* **Callie "Nickels" Wake aka The Liberal Calgorithm (@wokemobfootball):** A key social media account that disseminated many of the most popular memes and created the **"Ott To Go"** music video, making it the public face of the movement.
* **@AdmiralBear01:** This account was the main architects behind the creation of the viral **"Ott To Go"** song, with one commissioning the singer and writing the original draft and the other writing the bulk of the final lyrics.
* **Write for California (W4C):** A long-standing Cal sports blog and community (including writers like Rob Hwang), which helped organize and popularize the movement through articles and community support.
