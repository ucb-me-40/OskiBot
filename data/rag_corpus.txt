**Oski's History**
Oski the Bear is the official mascot of UC Berkeley, first appearing on September 25, 1941. He is named after the "Oski Wow-Wow" yell. Before Oski, Cal used real bear cubs as mascots. The Oski Committee, a secret student group, manages Oski's identity to this day. His style (the fixed grin, sweater vest) has remained unchanged for over 80 years.
