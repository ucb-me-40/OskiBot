**Oski's History**
Oski the Bear is the official mascot of UC Berkeley, first appearing on September 25, 1941. He is named after the "Oski Wow-Wow" yell.
Before Oski, Cal used real bear cubs as mascots. The Oski Committee, a secret student group, manages Oski's identity to this day.
His style (the fixed grin, sweater vest) has remained unchanged for over 80 years.

**Cal Football Conference**
The California Golden Bears football team recently moved to the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) as of 2024. They previously competed in the Pac-12.
Their home stadium is California Memorial Stadium, built in 1923. The team colors are Blue and Gold.
The current head coach is Justin Wilcox.

**The Stanford Axe**
The Stanford Axe is the trophy awarded to the winner of the annual "Big Game" rivalry between Cal and Stanford.

**College GameDay $100K Kicker**
During the College GameDay broadcast on October 5, 2024, civil engineering student **Daniel Villasenor** won $100,000 in a fan field goal kick competition. He successfully hit a 33-yard field goal on his second attempt, with host Pat McAfee raising the prize and pledging a matching donation to Hurricane Helene relief efforts.

**Marshawn Lynch (Beast Mode)**
Marshawn Lynch, known as "Beast Mode," is one of Cal Football's most famous alumni. He played for the Golden Bears from 2004 to 2006, earning First-team All-American and Pac-10 Offensive Player of the Year honors in 2006. He is the second-leading rusher in Cal program history. His most iconic moment at Cal was commandeering a medical cart after an overtime victory against Washington in 2006, driving it around the field in celebration.

**Fernando Mendoza and "The Drive of 2024"**
The phrase **"I'll remember going 98 yards with my boys"** originated from an emotional, tear-filled post-game interview given by Cal quarterback **Fernando Mendoza** after he led the Golden Bears on an **11-play, 98-yard, game-winning touchdown drive** against rival **Stanford** in the 2024 Big Game (November 23, 2024). The drive, which started from Cal’s 2-yard line, resulted in a 24-21 victory, securing Cal’s **bowl eligibility** (6-6) and ensuring the team retained the **Stanford Axe**. Mendoza’s raw emotion and the legendary quote solidified him as a cult hero among the Cal fanbase.

**Jaydn Ott and "Ott To Go"**
**Jaydn Ott** is the star Cal running back who was the subject of the viral fan-made song, **"Ott To Go."** The song is a parody of the popular Chappell Roan track "Hot To Go" and features lyrics about Ott's dominance, such as, "Can we get Jaydn Ott-To-Go?" The song became an anthem for the movement, especially during the lead-up to the **College GameDay** appearance in Berkeley.

**Key Architects of the Calgorithm**
The Calgorithm was a decentralized, collective fan movement, but several key individuals and social media accounts were responsible for its viral spread:

* **Miles Goodman (@golDonbear):** Credited with posting the original, viral meme after Cal's win over Auburn, featuring the phrase: "**You just lost to the woke agenda.**" This post served as the movement's ignition point.
* **The Liberal Calgorithm (@wokemobfootball):** A key social media account that disseminated many of the most popular memes and created the **"Ott To Go"** music video, making it the public face of the movement.
* **@nyt_wordle_bot and @AdmiralBear01:** These accounts were the main architects behind the creation of the viral **"Ott To Go"** song, with one commissioning the singer and writing the original draft and the other writing the bulk of the final lyrics.
* **Micky Hage:** She is a professional singer who performed the vocals for the viral **"Ott To Go"** parody track.
* **Write for California (W4C):** A long-standing Cal sports blog and community, which helped organize and popularize the movement through articles and community support.
* **Other Key Contributors (@Dalmcm, @atomsareenough, @Oskisstraw, @MikeHotDogMayor, @GhostofGarbers):** Beyond the high-profile individuals, the Calgorithm's success was driven by a decentralized collective of highly creative "burners" and accounts, including **@Dalmcm**, **@atomsareenough** (credited on the "Ott To Go" song), **@Oskisstraw** (dedicated to the Oski's Drinking Straw meme), **@MikeHotDogMayor** (a popular figure from the broader Bay Area sports community who engages with the Calgorithm content), and **@GhostofGarbers** (an active meme creator and contributor named after former Cal QB Chase Garbers). These members are vital to the continuous production of viral memes, graphics, and satirical content that fueled the movement and brought national attention to Cal Football.
* **Other Key Contributors ** @CalVsTheWorld: A highly prolific Cal Football fan account that contributed to the collective of "burners" who generated the satirical memes and online chatter for the Calgorithm. @RexVolcano: A highly prolific Cal Football fan account and "burner" that contributed significantly to the Calgorithm's viral spread of satirical memes and online content.


**Oski: The Dark Lord of the Woke Mob**
Oski is affectionately and satirically referred to as the "**Dark Lord**" or "**Chairman Oski**" by members of the Calgorithm community. This nickname is an extension of his god-like status and aligns with the movement's satirical "Woke Mob" theme. The term is frequently used by key Calgorithm accounts, including **@AdmiralBear01** (one of the main lyricists of the "Ott To Go" song), cementing Oski's role as the supreme leader of the viral fan base.

**Avinash Kunnath's Role**
**Avinash Kunnath** is the **Site Czar** for **Write for California (W4C)**, a major Cal sports fan community. He is recognized as a key leader and strategist who articulated the Calgorithm's core philosophy: leaning into the **"Berkeley woke, Berkeley liberal"** stereotypes with self-aware humor. His public commentary helped frame the satirical narrative, which was crucial to the movement's success and its ability to take "the power away from all the things people made fun of us for."

**Oski's Drinking Straw**
Oski is famously known for a grotesque but necessary tradition: the use of a **"Drinking Straw"** (often a clear tube) threaded through a small hole in his eye or mouth to allow the student inside the suit to drink water. Since Oski’s iconic fixed grin head does not open, this method is essential for hydration during games. The Calgorithm movement adopted this detail, using it to satirize the mascot's creepy, antiquated design and further cement his image as an **immortal being** with arcane, strange needs.

**Burners (Calgorithm Contributors)**
A **"burner"** is a term used to describe the individual content creators and social media accounts that form the decentralized collective of the Calgorithm fan movement.
These highly creative individuals are vital to the continuous production of viral memes, graphics, and satirical content that fueled the movement and brought national attention to Cal Football.

**Rich Lyons and The Drive**
On November 24, 2024, UC Berkeley Chancellor Rich Lyons tweeted: "First was The Play. Then came The Drive. All 98 yards of it." The tweet refers to the 11-play, 98-yard game-winning touchdown drive led by QB Fernando Mendoza that secured Cal's 24-21 comeback victory over Stanford in the 127th Big Game on November 23, 2024.

**@CalBearsHistory**
The **@CalBearsHistory** social media account and associated website are dedicated to sharing the history of the University of California, Berkeley, with a particular focus on Cal Sports history (including football) and notable alumni. This account serves as a major resource for the Cal fan base, providing historical context and pride that is often leveraged or referenced by the Calgorithm movement, though it is not a satirical "burner" account itself.

**The Phoenix Five (Stanford Tree Kidnapping)**
On **October 17, 1998**, a group of five University of California, Berkeley (Cal) students known as the **"Phoenix Five"** broke into the Stanford Band Shak in Palo Alto and kidnapped the **Stanford Tree** mascot. The costume was held "hostage" for two weeks before its return. Fueled by intense media coverage and administrative reactions, this event became one of the most famous pranks in the Big Game rivalry. The prank is famously recognized as the **#1 mascot theft in college sports history** by publications like Bleacher Report.

**Daniel Villasenor's Vans**
<<<<<<< HEAD
When UC Berkeley civil engineering student **Daniel Villasenor** successfully kicked a 33-yard field goal to win $100,000 on ESPN's *College GameDay* on October 5, 2024, he was famously wearing a well-worn pair of **Vans Classic Checkerboard Slip-Ons**.

**The Calgorithm**
The "Calgorithm" is a viral, fan-driven **social media movement** created by a collective of content creators called "**burners**".
